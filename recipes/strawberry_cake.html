    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Delicious Strawberry Crepe Cake dusted with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 ¼ cups whole milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) jar strawberry jam</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>¾ cup mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour eggs, flour, sugar, salt, oil, milk, and vanilla extract into a blender. Blend, starting on low speed and finishing on high, until combined. Refrigerate batter for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scoop strawberry jam into a saucepan. Rinse out jar with water and pour into the saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and stir. Simmer for 1 minute, remove from heat, and stir. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Brush some butter over a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour in 1/4 cup batter; tilt pan to coat evenly. Cook until crepes bubble and brown, about 1 1/2 minutes per side. Transfer to a baking sheet. Repeat with remaining batter, buttering the pan between crepes. Let cool completely before stacking, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lay a crepe onto a large plate. Spoon on 2 or 3 tablespoons of the cream mixture, spreading it almost to the edge. Swirl in some strawberry jam. Transfer finished crepe onto a flat serving plate. Repeat with remaining crepes, cream, and jam. Center each crepe over the previous one in a stack. Gently press on a final plain crepe to finish.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate until completely chilled before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
